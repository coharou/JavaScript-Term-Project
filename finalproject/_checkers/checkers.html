                <h1>Controls & Tips</h1>
                <p>&emsp; Start by assigning players their teams: blue or red. Set up the pieces on the dark grey squares.
                    Blue team will go first. Pieces may only move diagonally. To capture an opponent, move over it to an open diagonal tile beyond it.</p>

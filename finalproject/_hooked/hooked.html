                    &emsp; ... is a 2D side-scroller where the player is equipped with a grappling hook, and tasked with flinging themselves over dangerous obstacles to reach the finish.
                    There's one, extensive level without any checkpoints included. Being hit once is an instant death, causing a restart all the way back at the beginning.

                    &emsp; The objective of the game is to reach the light blue platform on the bottom right of the player's screen.
                    To reach it, the player will need to pass by the red hazards sprinkled across the level.
                    Players are equipped with a grappling hook, where they can click on a grey platform to attach themselves to.
                    They will be launched towards the platform, and will stick to it until they click on another grey platform to latch on to.
                    There are numerous ways to reach the end platform - typically, the faster the route, the riskier it is for the player.

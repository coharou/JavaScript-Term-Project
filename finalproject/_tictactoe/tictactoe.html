                <p>&emsp; The objective is to have three squares marked in a row - either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal - on the 3x3 board, all by one team.
                    The first player will always be assigned the blue team, while the second player will be assigned the red team. 
                    To choose a square, simply press it during your turn.</p>

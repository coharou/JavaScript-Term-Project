///     GAME DESCRIPTION
///------------------------------
Tic-Tac-Toe is the traditional pen-and-paper game brought to a digital platform. 
There are no differences in how it plays here. 
It is suggested to be played with another person at your computer or through a stream.

///     HOW TO PLAY
///------------------------------
In order to play the game, there must be two players. 
The first player will always be assigned the blue team, while the second player will be assigned the red team. 
The objective is to have three squares marked in a row - either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal - on the 3x3 board, all by one team. 
If the blue team clicks the top left square, the square's background color will become blue. 
Then, it will be the red team's turn to play. 
The red team cannot click a square that the blue team holds, and vice versa. 
Most games will end in a tie. Due to a bug, players will have to click refresh to play another match.

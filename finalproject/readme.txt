///     GAME DESCRIPTIONS
///------------------------------
1)  Tic-Tac-Toe is the traditional pen-and-paper game brought to a digital platform. There are no differences in how it plays here.
    It is suggested to be played with another person at your computer or through a stream.
    To liven the experience, there are multiple board styles and designs are available for the user to choose from.
2)  Checkers CTF is similar to the board game version, with a major twist: the board is triangular, with one corner having a flag, and the other two holding the players.
    Players must balance effectively dodging their opponents like in the original game, while also trying to pull the flag back to their corner.
3)  "Hooked!" is a 2D side-scroller where the player is equipped with a grappling hook, and tasked with flinging themselves over dangerous obstacles to reach the finish.
    There's one, extensive level without any checkpoints included. Being hit once is an instant death, causing a restart all the way back at the beginning.

///     GAME DESCRIPTIONS
///------------------------------
1)  Tic-Tac-Toe is the traditional pen-and-paper game brought to a digital platform. There are no differences in how it plays here.
    It is suggested to be played with another person at your computer or through a stream.
2)  Checkers, like Tic-Tac-Toe, is the old board game version moved online. 
    Players must balance effectively taking their opponents pieces, while not losing their own.
3)  "Hooked!" is a 2D side-scroller where the player is equipped with a grappling hook, and tasked with flinging themselves over dangerous obstacles to reach the finish.
    There's one, extensive level without any checkpoints included. Being hit once is an instant death, causing a restart all the way back at the beginning.
